### Shake to create Feedback

When the [TestFairy SDK](https://docs.testfairy.com/SDK/Adding_The_SDK_To_Your_App.html) is defined in your app shaking the device will prompt the user to create a feedback issue from within the app.
The issue will appear with an automatically generated screenshot of the app which can be annotated and a feedback form where details like email and description can be added.

It is also possible to automatically integrate [Bug Tracking](https://docs.testfairy.com/Bug_Tracking/Overview.html) systems to your issues so when they are created the issues are passed automatically.
