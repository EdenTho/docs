## Email Integrations

In order to increase deliverability and open rates of email messages you send out to users of the system connect your TestFairy account to your **SMTP**, G-suite **Gmail** service or your private Gmail account.

This way your users will get emails from a familiar email address, and will be able to reply directly to you. In addition you will be able to track outgoing messages by checking your `Sent Items` folder in your email account.

This option is recommended for all users and is **included in all packages**.
