## Zendesk
If you are using Zendesk as your support and ticketing system it is very easy to integrate it with your testfairy account to collect feedback you receive from customers using your app in production.

- Log in as the account owner and create a new team member.
- Use the email of the support domain in Zendesk. 
   
   (It looks something like this: `support@[YOUR DOMAIN NAME].zendesk.com`)
- Once you have this account do a password reset and log in to this account.
- While logged-in go to the [preferences â†’ notifications](https://app.testfairy.com/settings/notifications/) and check the `Email` box of **Receive notifications on user feedbacks**.
- Look at the bottom to make sure the emails will be sent to the correct Zendesk email address.

You are all set ! All feedback from your apps will be created as a Zendesk ticket.
