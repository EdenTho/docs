## Versioning your app builds

When loading an app to Testfairy the service decodes the version number and name of the build and displays it in the dashboard.


### Android


These are the two fields identifying a build: 

- **versionCode** - A positive integer used as an internal version number.
- **versionName** â€” A string used as the version number shown to users. 


These fields will be translated and displayed in the following fields on the TestFairy Dashboard:

- Version = **versionName**
- Version code = **versionCode** - displayed in (brackets) after the version field.

### iOS:


These are 2 fields for identifying the app:

- **Bundle version** - a string composed of one to three period-separated integers. Can only contain numeric characters (0-9) and periods.
- **Bundle versions string, short** - a string.


These fields will be translated and displayed in the following fields on the TestFairy Dashboard:

- Version = **Bundle versions string, short** 
- Version code = **Bundle version** - displayed in (brackets) after the version field.
