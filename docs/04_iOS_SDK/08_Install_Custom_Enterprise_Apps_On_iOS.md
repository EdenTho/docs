### Manually install and trust an enterprise app
When you first open an enterprise app that you've manually installed, you see a notification that the developer of the app isn't trusted on your device. You can dismiss this message, but then you can't open the app.

To establish trust for the app developer tap Settings → General → Profiles or Profiles & Device Management. 
Under the "Enterprise App" heading, you see a profile for the developer of the app you want to trust.

Once you trust this profile, you can install and run any other apps from the same developer. This developer will remain trusted until you remove all apps of this developer.
