### The TestFairy SDK

TestFairy's SDK takes your app to the next level. Our tools help you understand how users really interact with your app. We handle problems like crashes and on-screen error messages, and we even integrate with your current development workflow.

Some of our features include:

- Recording videos of how users interact with your apps
- Handling crashes and exceptions
- Sending logs to the TestFairy dashboard for later inspection
- Identifying and tagging users, for searching and custom reports
- Auto-Updates, to make sure your users are on the latest version
