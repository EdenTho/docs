TestFairy provides mechanism to encrypt the logs and the screenshots that are recorded from the mobile device.

This information is encrypted using a randomly generated 256-bit AES key. This AES key is random and is only used in a single session recording. The AES key is then protected with an RSA key, where the public key is provided when constructing the SDK.

#### Generating public/private key pair

Generating a pair is done using openssl tool:

```
openssl genrsa -out testfairy-private-key.pem 2048
openssl rsa -in testfairy-private-key.pem -outform DER -pubout | base64 - > testfairy-public-key.txt
```

This will create two files called `testfairy-private-key.pem` and `testfairy-public-key.txt` containing your private and public keys. 

The file `testfairy-private-key.pem` is sensitive and should not be shared with anyone that is not part of your team.

The content of `testfairy-public-key.txt` will be used to initialize the SDK. Please paste this value into the first parameter of `TestFairy.setEncryptionKey` method.

#### Using in Android 

Enable end-to-end encryption for your Android apps by calling `setEncryptionKey` before calling the `begin` method.

```
TestFairy.setEncryptionKey("<PUBLIC KEY>");
TestFairy.begin("<APP TOKEN>");
```

#### Using in iOS

Enable end-to-end encryption for your iOS apps by calling `setEncryptionKey` before calling the `begin` method.

```
[TestFairy setEncryptionKey:@"<PUBLIC KEY>"]; 
[TestFairy begin:@"<APP TOKEN>"];
```

#### Viewing sessions

Since the data is encrypted using RSA, viewing a session requires the private key. Simply visiting a recorded session will prompt a dialog for entry of the RSA Private Key. Just paste the private key text and click "OK". Your private keys are never sent to the server and are only kept within the browser session. 

**Important note:** it's cruical that you keep the private key safe. If lost, these sessions cannot be recovered and the recorded data will become useless.
